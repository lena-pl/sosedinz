# sosedinz
sosediNZ is a concept for a networking multi-blog platform for Russian New Zealanders. This is a student project that I am undertaking as part of my study at Yoobee School of Design (Diploma of Web Development).

## Structure
Users can choose to register an account at sosediNZ after visiting the home page. Each registered user can have their own blog where they can post content. They may also choose to view and comment on other users' blog posts. The posts will be searchable by tags, with the search function available to both registered users and visitors. Admin users will have the ability to edit all content on the site at all times.
